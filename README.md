# School Project: Bank App with Oracle Database

![App Demo]


## About

This repository contains a school project developed using Flutter, a powerful and user-friendly framework for building cross-platform applications. The project aims to create a bank application that allows users to manage their finances, including creating accounts, making deposits, requesting loans, and withdrawing money.

## Why Flutter?

Flutter was chosen for this project due to its ease of use, rapid development capabilities, and ability to create a consistent user interface across multiple platforms. With Flutter, we can write a single codebase that runs on both Android and iOS devices, saving development time and effort.

## Hosting a Database Container on a Samsung Phone

One interesting technical aspect of this project involves using a container hosted on a Samsung phone as a database using SQL. By leveraging the computing power of a Samsung device, we ensure that data management is efficient and responsive. SQL queries are used to interact with the database, enabling seamless data storage and retrieval.

### Communication between the App and Container

The Flutter app and the database container communicate smoothly, thanks to the well-defined APIs and endpoints. The app establishes a secure connection to the database container using network protocols, enabling real-time data synchronization and updates.

## Bank App Features

The bank app developed for this project offers a range of features to empower users in managing their finances:

- **Account Creation**: Users can easily create new accounts by providing essential details.

- **Deposits**: Make deposits to increase your account balance securely.

- **Loan Requests**: Need funds? Users can request a loan through a straightforward process.

- **Withdrawals**: Conveniently withdraw money from your account whenever needed.

- **Overdraft Protection**: This bank app includes a unique feature allowing users to overdraft up to a maximum of $50. This can be a helpful buffer for minor financial emergencies.

- **Branch Management**: As the bank expands, new branches can be opened directly from the app. Each branch can hire employees and offer services to local customers.

## Listing Branches by State

The app provides a convenient way to list all branches by state. Users can easily navigate through the branches in their desired location, facilitating efficient customer service and engagement.
